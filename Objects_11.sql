-- ## Advanced Challenge
-- To perform the following activity, refer to the tables in the JustLee Books database. Using the training you have received and speculating on query needs, determine appropriate uses for indexes and sequences in the JustLee Books database. Assume all tables will grow quite large in the number of rows. Identify at least three sequences and three indexes that can address needed functionality for the JustLee Books database. In a memo to management, you should identify each sequence and index that you propose and the rationale supporting your suggestions. You should also state any drawbacks that might affect database performance if the changes are implemented.
